--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ..../i-pi_v1.0beta/i-pi file is the main script from which the simulation is 
run. 

The ...examples/tutorial/tutotial-1/tutorial-1.xml file specifies a .pdb output 
format not .xyz as mentioned in the tutorial.

The simulation ends with a message,
    "ERROR reading from socket: Success"
This is normal behaviour. 
When the i-pi program stops the driver program can no longer detect the server
and therefore reports an error.  
The "tail -f log" command will "hang" at this point and should be stopped by 
entering "ctrl C".
